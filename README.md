Football Reactions is the perfect place for football fans to come together on one platform and speak just about football. Football reaction gives users the chance to state if they are a fan or if they are a club. They can make posts or join in conversations regarding certain topics and communicate together and share opinions. This repository is the frontend of Football Reactions using React Framework.

### Colours and Fonts.

As I am not very artisic, I went online to find colour schemes and fonts which pair up well together.

- I have used a darker colour scheme before in one of my projects and the feedback given was that a lighter and friendlier colour scheme would have made the website more appealing. So afer searching online I came across a colour scheme (which I went through a focus group with friends) which provided a friendly pairing. Although football wasn't on one of the suggested reasons on the website, it was the most popular with my focus group. I went with 2 majority colours as football kits are generaly made up of 2 colours. So to fit in with the football theme I choose the two.

- I also looked up my fonts online. The scheme given was suggested for the same type of industry/website ideas. After going through a selection with a focus group of friends, the most popular was the combination below. These fonts provided a professional look to the website which was the way I decided to go. I was on the fence regarding a unsual style to stand out, but after my focus group, a professional look was suggested as the desired look.
